			<h2> History </h2>
			<p> Durham House of Pets is a family owned local business founded in 1978. Passed down through generations, our shop has evolved greatly over the years. When we first opened, we only carried a select few pets including fish, hampsters, rabbits, and birds. Today, we carry all of these and much more ranging from gerbils to cat adoptions. We always have new pets coming into the shop, waiting for a great owner to take them to their new home! Not only do we carry the animals themseleves, we also carry supplies needed for every pet. Whether it be the tank need for your fish , the bed need for your dog, or the food you need for your bunny, we have got it all!  </p>
